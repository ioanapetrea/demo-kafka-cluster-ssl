Error:
Caused by: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.SslAuthenticationException: SSL handshake failed

Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException:
PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target

root certificate should be provided by another CA on top of your CA ( this is called as the certificate chain )

DEBUG Error:
https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/unable-to-connect-to-ssl-services-due-to-pkix-path-building-failed-error-779355358.html  => this clearly states that the certificates used to connect to kafka are the wrong ones.
